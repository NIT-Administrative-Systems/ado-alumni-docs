Welcome to the Northwestern IT Administrative Systems ADO Alumni documentation site.

:::warning In Development
This site is currently in development. Stay tuned for more updates.

## Configuration
This site is built on [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/). Comprised primarily of markdown files, it's easy to modify and preview right on GitHub. 

Once on the site itself, the fastest way to update is by clicking the 'Edit Page' link at the bottom of a page. This will bring you directly to GitHub with an editor open.

For more involved changes, you can run a local copy of the website:

1. Log into Github account and [clone the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

2. [Install dependencies for the project](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/installing-dependencies/) using:

    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```
    or just

    ```sh
    yarn
    ```

3. Run the local copy in the terminal using:

    ```sh
    yarn run docs:dev
    ```
